            <p><em>What are the quintessential novels of the world?</em></p>
            <p>I aim to explore this question through this website.</p>
            <p>Though there are innumerable literary works from around the world worth celebrating, this website highlights what is commonly deemed as the utmost quintessential fictional novel from each country. These books are written by an author from the country and originally in the country’s native language and are widely read, highly acclaimed, and enduringly popular among the country’s population across generations and socio-economic classes. </p>
            <p>Of course, dozens of novels from each country meet this criteria, and deciding which one is the most quintessential novel is inherently contestable and perhaps even immeasurable. Regardless, the amateur methodology I use for my website is a combination of online research as well as personal observation, or what I discover when traveling and speaking to people I meet during my journey and observing the books that frequent bookshelves at homes, coffee shops and book stores. </p>
            <p>I hope my curated list sparks interest in literature from across the globe. This list will expand to hopefully one day include every country, and later multiple novels from various fiction genres.</p>
