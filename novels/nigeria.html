        <h2> <em>Things Fall Apart</em>
        <p>CHINUA ACHEBE</p></h2>
        <p><em><strong>Things Fall Apart</strong></em> is a literary novel written by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe in 1958. The story's main theme concerns pre- and post-colonial life in late nineteenth century Nigeria. It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, one of the first to receive global critical acclaim. It is a staple book in schools throughout Africa and is widely read and studied in English-speaking countries around the world. It was first published in 1958 by William Heinemann Ltd in the UK; in 1962, it was also the first work published in Heinemann's African Writers Series. The title of the novel comes from a line in W. B. Yeats' poem "The Second Coming". </p>
        <p><strong>Language Choice</strong></p>
        <p>Achebe wrote his novels in English because written Standard Igbo was created by combining various dialects, creating a stilted written form. In a 1994 interview with The Paris Review, Achebe said, "the novel form seems to go with the English language. There is a problem with the Igbo language. It suffers from a very serious inheritance which it received at the beginning of this century from the Anglican mission. They sent out a missionary by the name of Dennis. Archdeacon Dennis. He was a scholar. He had this notion that the Igbo language—which had very many different dialects—should somehow manufacture a uniform dialect that would be used in writing to avoid all these different dialects. Because the missionaries were powerful, what they wanted to do they did. This became the law. But the standard version cannot sing. There's nothing you can do with it to make it sing. It's heavy. It's wooden. It doesn't go anywhere."</p>
        <p>Achebe's choice to write in English has caused controversy. While both African and non-African critics agree that Achebe modelled <em>Things Fall Apart</em> on classic European literature, they disagree about whether his novel upholds a Western model, or, in fact, subverts or confronts it. Achebe continued to defend his decision: "English is something you spend your lifetime acquiring, so it would be foolish not to use it. Also, in the logic of colonization and decolonization it is actually a very powerful weapon in the fight to regain what was yours. English was the language of colonization itself. It is not simply something you use because you have it anyway."</p>
        <p>Achebe is noted for his inclusion of and weaving in of proverbs from Igbo oral culture into his writing. This influence was explicitly referenced by Achebe in <em>Things Fall Apart</em>: "Among the Igbo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten."</p>
        <p><strong>Reception</strong></p>
        <p><em>Things Fall Apart</em> is a milestone in African literature. It has come to be seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and is read in Nigeria and throughout Africa. Of all of Achebe's works, <em>Things Fall Apart</em> is the one read most often, and has generated the most critical response, examination, and literary criticism. It is studied widely in Europe, India and North America, where it has spawned numerous secondary and tertiary analytical works. It has achieved similar status and repute in India, Australia and Oceania. Considered Achebe's magnum opus, it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. <em>Time Magazine</em> included the novel in its <em>TIME 100 Best English-language Novels</em> from 1923 to 2005. The novel has been translated into more than fifty languages, and is often used in literature, world history, and African studies courses across the world.</p>
        <p>Achebe is now considered to be the essential novelist on African identity, nationalism, and decolonization. Achebe's main focus has been cultural ambiguity and contestation. The complexity of novels such as <em>Things Fall Apart</em> depends on Achebe's ability to bring competing cultural systems and their languages to the same level of representation, dialogue, and contestation. </p>
